# flask-series

In this series we'll be creating a Flask app from scratch.

## Part 1: Installing Flask and Creating a Basic App
Here we'll create a very basic working Flask application. But before that, we'll create a virtual environment and install all the required packages.

## Part 2: Routing in Flask
In this part we'll discuss routing in Flask in detail. We'll be talking about static and dynamic routes. We'll explore URL processors and URL parameters.

We'll learn how to handle the GET, POST, PUT and DELETE HTTP requests. Last but not least, we'll learn how to tweak the response object by setting the status code, the headers, and so on.

## Part 3: Templates in Flask
In this part we'll be talking about templates in Flask. We'll be talking about static and dynamic HTML content. We'll be using the Jinja templating engine.
We'll also see how to extend templates, use Jinja filters and dynamic URLs and how to handle redirections.

## Part 4: POST Requests in Flask
In this part we'll be talking about POST requests in Flask. We'll learn how to submit a form to the server. We'll also learn how to upload files. 
In particular, we'll see how to upload an image file and a CSV file and then display their contents in the browser.

## Part 5: Static Files in Flask
In this part of the series we’ll be talking about static files in Flask. What are static files in the first place? Well, these are CSS files, JavaScript scripts, images, and so on. 
So, how do we load JavaScript scripts into our HTML files? How do we link stylesheets? How do we write paths to our images? Also, we’ll integrate Bootstrap into our app to get a whole 
bunch of beautiful styles out of the box.

## Part 6: Sessions and Cookies in Flask
In this part of the series we’ll be talking about preserving information across multiple requests using sessions and cookies. Both sessions and cookies are used to preserve information 
across multiple requests. The major difference between sessions and cookies is the place where the information is stored. Sessions are used on the server side and if the information 
is sensitive and needs to be kept secure, this is the way to go. Otherwise, we can use cookies to save it in the user’s browser on the client side.

## Part 7: Databases in Flask
We’re going to use the SQLite database in our app. When working with databases in Flask, we don’t work directly with the tables, but rather with objects that are mapped to tables using 
an object-relational mapper (ORM). The ORM we’re going to use is SQLAlchemy. We'll add functionality to add new items to the database, to delete items and to display detailed information 
about a selected item.
